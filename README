StarCanvas displays an interactive map of a galaxy in an HTML canvas element, dividing into selectable grids of 20LYx20LY (based on Star Trek lore).

Online example: http://www.colorfulwolf.com/dev/starcanvas/demo/

The map area is draggable and zoomable. Grid click events can be intercepted using a listener (see demo/index.html).

Backgrounds are automatically tiled. Multiple backgrounds can be specified, each for a different zoom level with a different alpha range (see demo/index.html).

Requirements:
- jquery
- jquery.mousewheel.js

Disclaimer: the images and font used in the demo page are not owned by me and are merely supplied as an example.
